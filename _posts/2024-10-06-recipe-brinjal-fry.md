This is a simple recipe for a delicious South Indian style **Eggplant (aka Brinjal, aka Katthirikkaai)** fry. While it is a great side dish to pair with various South Indian dishesm it also works a unique way to incorporate eggplants as a side dish for your favourite rice or bread even if you are not familiar with South Indian cuisine.

## Ingredients

### Common
- Brinjal (~250 grams)
- Onions (~150 grams / 1 large or 2 small)
- Neutral tasting Oil (2 tablespoons)

### Indian / special
- Black mustard seeds (2.5 g / 1 teaspoon)
- Urad dal (14 grams)
- Sambar Powder (2.5 - 3.5 g / 1.5 teaspoon)
- Coriander powder (1.2 g / 1 teaspoon)
- _Gingely oil (2 tablespoons) - optional_
- _Curry leaves (4-5 leaves) - optional_

## Preparation

- Wash and dry the brinjal. Remove the stem and green crown and chop. 
  - If they are the small round variety (which are nicer if you can get them - Indian variety as seen [here](https://foodwise.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Eggplant_guide_labeled.png)), either cut them lengthwise into quarters if small or eights if large. If you are one of the other bigger varieties, cut them into approximately 2 or 3 cm cubes.
- Peel and dice the onions into small pieces.
- _If you plan to use curry leaves, separate the leaves from the stem, wash and dry them._

## Recipe

1. Heat up a 2 tablespoons of oil (let it warm up a little bit on medium heat).
2. To the oil, add about a teaspoon of black mustard seeds and wait for them to get fried. When a few seeds start to pop add  teaspoons of urad dal.
3. Watch the urad dal as they are fried and let them turn brown until they are crispy rather than chewy. _If you have curry leaves, add them now and let it splutter._
4. Add the onions into the pot.
5. Add 1 teaspoon of sambar powder, salt, and 1 teaspoon of coriander powder.
6. Chop the brinjal into large cubes or if they are the small round variety, either cut them into quarters or split them into quarters and fill them with the fried onions.
7. Add a splash of water and cook covered until the brinjals turn soft.
8. Remove the cover and continue cooking until they get dry and roasted.

## Suggested pairing

### Genaral
It is not saucy but works as a side dish to pair with rice or bread.

### South Indian
Serve as a side with kootu and rice, sambar and rice or if you're up for something simpler, with plain curd rice.
