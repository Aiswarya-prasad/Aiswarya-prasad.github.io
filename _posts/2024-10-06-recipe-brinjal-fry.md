This is a simple recipe for a delicious South Indian style **Eggplant (aka Brinjal, aka Katthirikkaai)** fry. While it is a great side dish to pair with various South Indian dishesm it also works a unique way to incorporate eggplants as a side dish for your favourite rice or bread even if you are not familiar with South Indian cuisine.

I find that indian recipies often use terms that are only understood by others who are familiar with the techniques used in the cuisine (eg. fry tomato-onion mix until the oil begins to separate, cook the rice for 3 whistles). I have done my best to avoid this and be as descriptive as possible but please let me know if I slipped up! I have added links to pictures - borrowed from vastly different sources - to help you identify the ingredients or cooking steps if you are unfamiliar with them (I might add my own pictures in the future). I often find weight measurements more convenient - especially since I set up a palm sized kitchen scale in an easily accessible spot in my kitchen - but the quantities do not need to be so precisely measured so feel free to use volumes or eyeball them if you are used to the ingradients! 

## Ingredients (for 2-3 servings)

### Common
- Brinjal (~250 grams)
- Onions (~150 grams / 1 large or 2 small)
- Neutral tasting Oil (2 tablespoons)

### Indian / special
- Black mustard seeds (2.5 g / 1 teaspoon)
- Urad dal (14 grams / 1 tablespoon)
- Sambar Powder (2.5 - 3.5 g / 1.5 teaspoon)
- Coriander powder (1.2 g / 1 teaspoon)
- _Gingely oil (2 tablespoons) - optional_
- _Curry leaves (4-5 leaves) - optional_

### Kitchen hardware

No special equipment. I like to use an iron wok (a chinese wok can work too) or kadai (as my mother would) but any heavy bottomed pan will work. Just make sure you are able to cover it with a lid and that it is big enough that the brinjal can be spread out in more or less a single layer.

### Note about the ingredients

The ingredients are quite simple and you can find the ones listed under Common in most grocery stores. The others should be found in any Indian store. Below are some notes about the ingredients but feel free to skip to the next section if you are familiar with them or are ready to jump in with all the ingredients on hand.

- **Brinjal**: I find that the small round variety (referred to as Indian variety as seen on this picture [here](https://foodwise.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Eggplant_guide_labeled.png)) is the best for this recipe. If you can't find them, the other varieties will work too.
- **Onions**
  - I prefer red onions for this recipe but any onion will work. The onions form the base of the dish and add a lot of flavour from their sweetness brought out by the frying.
- **Oil**
  Any neutral oil (Sunflower oil, Canola oil, etc.) will work well. If you have Gingely oil (available in Indian stores), it adds a nice flavour to the dish. Gingely oil is specifically popular in South Indian cuisine and it is made from sesame seeds. It is processed differently and hence has a different flavor from the sesame oil used in other parts of Asia.
- **Black mustard seeds** and **Urad dal**
  These are a common duo used in South Indian cooking. The mustard seeds add a nice flavour and the urad dal adds a nice crunch to the dish.
  Try not to substitute these with other seeds or lentils as they are quite unique in flavour and texture. However, if in a pinch, you can substitute the urad dal with channa dal which also can get crispy but I find that less enjoyable.
- **Sambar powder**
  This is a powdered spice mix that is commonly used in South Indian cooking. It is a mix of various spices and lentils and is most commonly made by each household with their own minor variations. 
  Adjust the quantity based on mix you have. If unsure, go for 1 teaspoon and mix into the onions taste after a few minutes and add more if it is not too spicy.
  You can find many brands selling this in Indian stores or make it at home. If you can't find it, you can substitute it with a mix of coriander powder (1 teaspoon), cumin powder (1 teaspoon), and red chili (0.5 teaspoon) powder for this dish.
- **Coriander powder**
  This is a common spice used in Indian cooking. It is made from dried coriander seeds and has a warm, citrusy flavour. For peoplw who are genetically predisposed to dislike coriander, I have been quite different from fresh coriander leaves so it does not taste like soap!
- **Curry leaves**
  These are a common herb used in South Indian cooking. They freeze very well so if you can find them fresh, you can freeze them and use them as needed. They add a nice flavour to the dish. If you can't find them, you can skip them.
- **Other additions**
  A variation that is well-liked at home is adding peanuts to the dish. We add raw unroasted, unsalted peanuts to the dish when at the very beginning and fry them in the oil until they are roasted. They add a nice crunch to the dish. If you are interested in trying this, add about a tablespoon of peanuts (with or without skin - not the shell on) to the oil before adding the mustard seeds.

## Preparation

- Wash and dry the brinjal. Remove the stem and green crown and chop. 
  - If they are the small round variety, cut them lengthwise into quarters if small or eighths if larger. If you are using one of the other bigger varieties, cut them into approximately 2 or 3 cm cubes.
- Peel and dice the onions into small pieces.
- _If you plan to use curry leaves, separate the leaves from the stem, wash and dry them._

## Recipe

1. Heat up a 2 tablespoons of oil (let it warm up a little bit on medium heat). The more oil you use, the crispier the dish will be. If you are using gingely oil, it has a lower smoking point so be careful not to let it get too hot.
2. To the oil, add about a teaspoon of black mustard seeds and wait for it to splutter. When a few seeds start to pop add 1 tablespoon of urad dal.
3. Watch the urad dal as they turn brown (as seen [here](https://b2958125.smushcdn.com/2958125/wp-content/uploads/ulundu-paruppu-chutney-tamil-recipe-without-coconut-ulutham-paruppu-1.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)) until they are crispy rather than chewy (try a piece if it is your first time using this lentil variety this way). _If you have curry leaves, add them at this point and let them fry for a few seconds until scalded._
4. Add the onions into the pot and fry them until they start to look translucent. _If you are in no hurry, let the onions go a little further until they just begin to change color_.
5. Add 1.5 teaspoon of sambar powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder and salt to taste (or a conservative amount that is your best guess and add more after you are able to taste the dish and decide).
6. Add the chopped brinjal and mix well until the mixture coats them well.
7. Add a splash of water () and cook covered until the brinjals turn soft and cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking
8. Check on the pot every few minutes and add another splash of water as it might start is sticking to the bottom and give it a stir. I usually end up doing this a couple of times.
9. When the brinjal is cooked through, remove the lid and let the water evaporate while frying the mix some more.s

## Suggested pairing

### Genaral
It is not saucy but works as a side dish to pair with rice or bread.

### South Indian
Serve as a side with kootu and rice, sambar and rice or if you're up for something simpler, with plain curd rice.
