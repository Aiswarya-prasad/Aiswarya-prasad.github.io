I have been learning to sing carnatic music since I was in primary school. Following a newfound appreciation for the art around 2018 as an undergrad student in Bangalore, I renewed classes and have been enjoying listening, singing and taking the opportunity to perform at various local events and contests. Here are a few videos of my performances in the past few years:


**Paaliseyenna** a Purandaradasa composition at a temple event in Bangalore 2018 for which I was awarded the second prize:
