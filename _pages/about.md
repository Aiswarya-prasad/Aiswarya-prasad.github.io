> I am eager to bridge the gap between fundamental research and actionable application. Academic research is intellectually fulfilling and fosters deep thinking and understanding. However, while its impact often remains within scholarly circles, it faces growing skepticism from the broader community that funds these efforts. This reflects the increasing expectation for research to contribute more directly to societal needs. Addressing core issues, especially in emerging fields, benefits from a nuanced approach. Yet, translating these insights into effective solutions requires skills such as strategic planning and execution, which are not typically emphasized in basic research. By combining my training in fundamental research with these essential skills, I am excited to drive innovation and the development of technology to address challenges in health, agriculture and sustainable food production.

<!-- # My Background

As an undergraduate in Bangalore, India, I was captivated by the idea of bacteria as engineerable machines that can be harnessed to solve global problems. This interest motivated me to co-found the first iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) team at our institute. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, involving countless hours of brainstorming and designing our genetically engineered system. We successfully secured funding and lab space, ultimately presenting our work at the iGEM competition in Boston. This effort laid the groundwork for future teams, who have since won gold medals and received special nominations.

My academic journey has continued to focus on bacteria in communities and their interactions within different environments, such as the human gut. For my MS thesis, I explored the human gut microbiome, establishing a cost-effective Nanopore sequencing system that facilitated collaboration with local doctors in India.

Building on my interest in studying bacterial communities, I started my PhD in Lausanne. I study gut microbiome diversity and its evolution. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sampling, bioinformatics, and synthetic microbial communities in our honeybee laboratory model. I am particularly excited about cutting-edge sequencing and bacterial community engineering techniques and have successfully integrated Metagenomics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing in my research. -->
