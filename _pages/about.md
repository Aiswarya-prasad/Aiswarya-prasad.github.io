> **About Me**: I am a scientist specializing in bioinformatics and microbial ecology, with a keen interest in understanding the complex interactions between bacteria and their environments. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to engineer synthetic microbial communities. I am excited about applying cutting-edge approaches like high-throughput genome-resolved metagenomics, long-read sequencing, and strain-level analysis and manipulation to gain unprecedented insights into microbial diversity and interactions. I thrive in multidisciplinary environments, where I can benefit from and contribute to diverse perspectives and expertise.

> **Vision**: Looking to the future, I am eager to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical, applied solutions. While fundamental research can be deeply fulfilling and encourages intellectual growth, it is increasingly met with skepticism by the broader community that funds it. This reflects a growing expectation for research to directly address societal needs. Tackling core challenges, particularly in emerging fields, requires a nuanced approach. However, translating insights from basic research into actionable solutions demands skills like strategic planning and executionâ€” often underemphasized in academia. By combining my training in fundamental research with these essential skills, I aim to drive innovation and develop technologies that address key challenges in health, agriculture, and sustainable food production.

<!-- # My Background
> Where I would like to go: 5 years from now I would like be able to say, "You know of that microbiome product which is now the only viable cure for a pressing women's health issue?" or "the most clean and sustainable solution to pest control?", I made that happen!

As an undergraduate in Bangalore, India, I was captivated by the idea of bacteria as engineerable machines that can be harnessed to solve global problems. This interest motivated me to co-found the first iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) team at our institute. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, involving countless hours of brainstorming and designing our genetically engineered system. We successfully secured funding and lab space, ultimately presenting our work at the iGEM competition in Boston. This effort laid the groundwork for future teams, who have since won gold medals and received special nominations.

My academic journey has continued to focus on bacteria in communities and their interactions within different environments, such as the human gut. For my MS thesis, I explored the human gut microbiome, establishing a cost-effective Nanopore sequencing system that facilitated collaboration with local doctors in India.

Building on my interest in studying bacterial communities, I started my PhD in Lausanne. I study gut microbiome diversity and its evolution. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sampling, bioinformatics, and synthetic microbial communities in our honeybee laboratory model. I am particularly excited about cutting-edge sequencing and bacterial community engineering techniques and have successfully integrated Metagenomics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing in my research. -->
