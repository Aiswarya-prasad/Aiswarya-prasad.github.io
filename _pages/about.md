# Motivation

We live in an era where biotechnology is advancing so rapidly that methods once unimaginable a decade ago are now routine. This acceleration opens up vast opportunities for translating discoveries into novel therapies and sustainable solutions, particularly in emerging fields such as microbiome research. However, as the focus shifts toward practical applications, the deep thinking and nuanced understanding fostered by a fundamental research approach risk being undervalued. Leveraging my training in fundamental research, I am eager to bridge this gap by applying my knowledge to achieve tangible outcomes and make a meaningful impact.

# Journey

As an undergraduate in Bangalore, India, I was captivated by the idea of bacteria as engineerable machines that can be harnessed to solve global problems. This interest motivated me to co-found the first iGEM team at our institute. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, involving countless hours of brainstorming and designing our genetically engineered system. We successfully secured funding and lab space, ultimately presenting our work at the iGEM competition in Boston. This effort laid the groundwork for future teams, who have since won gold medals and received special nominations.

My academic journey has continued to focus on bacteria in communities and their interactions within different environments, such as the human gut. For my MS thesis, I explored the human gut microbiome, establishing a cost-effective Nanopore sequencing system that facilitated collaboration with local doctors in India.

Building on my interest in studying bacterial communities, I started my PhD in Lausanne. I study gut microbiome diversity and its evolution. I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sampling, bioinformatics, and synthetic microbial communities in our honeybee laboratory model. I am particularly excited about cutting-edge sequencing and bacterial community engineering techniques and have successfully integrated Metagenomics using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing in my research.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries of biotechnology and synthetic biology, with a commitment to developing innovative solutions that contribute to a healthier, more sustainable world.
