Education
======
Ph.D in Quantitative Biology, University of Lausanne | 2020 -- 2025 (expected)
M.S. in Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore | 2019 -- 2020
B.S. (research) in Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore | 2015 -- 2019

Research experience
======
* PhD candidate
  * University of Lausanne | AUG 2020 - PRESENT
Ecology and evolution of the honeybee gut microbiome
  <!-- * Led honeybee gut microbiome evolution research using next-generation sequencing and custom-made Snakemake pipelines.
  * Designed and conducted experiments on microbiota-free bees with synthetic bacterial communities to study their assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing.
  * Collaborated with multi-disciplinary teams in Malaysia and Kenya and initiated a new collaboration in India, expanding the study’s scope with cross-country data and mitigating delays due to pandemic restrictions in Malaysia by over one year. -->
* Master thesis research
  * Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | MAY 2019 - MAY 2020
Analysis of the human gut microbiome by Nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing
  <!-- * Established Nanopore sequencing system in a low-resource setting at 10% of the cost of other commonly available systems.
  * Developed an end-to-end pipeline from sample collection to bioinformatic analysis for metagenomics; tested various approaches for sample preparation and metaproteomic analysis of fecal samples using LC-MS/MS.
  * Analyzed the human gut microbiome in chronic pancreatitis patients, studying disease-related changes in collaboration with doctors. -->
* Undergraduate thesis research
  * Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | MAY 2019 - MAY 2020
Metaproteomic analysis of gut microbiomes from fecal samples

* Summer project student
  * Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine, Bengaluru | MAY 2017 - JUL 2017
Cloning and expression of native cockroach milk protein in yeast
  
* iGEM undergraduate research
  * Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | MAY 2016 - OCT 2016
Cellfiefuge: Auto-inducing and Auto-aggregating Bacteria
<!-- Proof-of-concept of a system to automate protein production using bacteria using auto-induction by quorum sensing and reversible auto-aggregation system in engineered E. coli -->
  <!-- * Co-founded the first team from the institute and secured a bronze medal at iGEM in Boston, a competition for innovative biotech solutions using genetically engineered machines.
  * Contributed to the designing and cloning of a quorum sensing-based auto-inducible system for protein overexpression in bacteria.
  * Engaged in teamwork to secure funding for research and travel via three grants. -->
