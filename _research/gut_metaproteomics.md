**Opportunity**:
    + As a undergraduate student, I was excited to work on a project that would utilize cutting-edge technology to study the gut microbiome.
    + I surveyed and tested various approaches for sample preparation and metaproteomic analysis of fecal samples using LC-MS/MS.

**Outcome**:
    + Successfully detected proteins of microbiome origin but concluded that higher detection power eg. using a nano-LC MS/MS would be needed for fecal metaproteomics.
