**Opportunity**:
    * As a Master's student ready to begin my thesis I was motivated to work on a project that would utilize a cutting-edge technology to study the gut microbiome which I was very excited about.
    * This excitement being contagious, my thesis supervisor, was convinced about investing in a Nanopore sequencer for the lab.
    * I used this opportunity to setup the Nanopore sequencer in the lab and developed my bioinformatic skills starting with setting up a Linux workstation for the lab and implementing a bioinformatic pipeline for metagenomics analysis.
**Outcome**:
    * I developed an end-to-end sampling and sequencing pipeline for metagenomics analysis of fecal samples using Nanopore sequencing in collaboration with a nearby hospital.
    * I analyzed the human gut microbiome in chronic pancreatitis patients and compared them with healthy samples to identify disease-related changes in the gut microbiome.
