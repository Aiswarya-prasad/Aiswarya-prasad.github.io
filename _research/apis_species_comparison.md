**Problem**: 
  * Animals including humans, other primates and mice have a much more diverse microbiome with many more species making them harder to study towards understanding how gut microbiota are distributed and have evolved. 
  * Honeybees are a great model to study the evolution and ecology of the gut microbiome with their simple and conserved gut microbiome and well-known host ecology and evolutionary history.
  * Studying gut microbiota evolution across animals is crucial for understanding symbiotic interactions but is hampered by the lack of high-resolution genomic data.

**Challenge**:
  * Previous studies have focused on highly diverse and variable systems, significant differences in relatedness and ecology of compared populations, geographic confounding factors, and reliance on low-resolution 16S rRNA analysis.

**Expectations and Results**:
  * Using shotgun metagenomics on 200 honeybee workers from five species, we recovered thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes, identifying several novel bacterial species.
  * We found both specialist and generalist bacteria, with notable variation between host species. Some generalists emerged host-specific only at the strain level, suggesting recent host switches. 
  * No evidence of codiversification was found; instead, symbiont gains, losses, and replacements led to functional differences, such as the ability to degrade pollen-derived pectin.
  * Our results provide new insights into gut microbiota evolution and uncover the functional potential of the previously underexplored gut microbiota of these important pollinators.
