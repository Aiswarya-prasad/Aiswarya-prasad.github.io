**Problem**: If you live in Europe or North America any honeybee you've seen flying about was most likely from a managed farm. "Wild" honeybees are only found across their natural habitats in **** most anywhere else, they have been transported by humans across the world over the past few centuries. With their simple and specialized gut microbiomes, honeybees make a great model to study the effects of domestication on the gut microbiome.

**Challenge**:
    * *Locating and sampling wild honeybees* from across the world is a daunting task. Thanks to our *international collaborators* across Africa, we have assembled an extensive collection of hundreds of honeybee samples.
    * The *differences are likely to be sublte* and cannot be eaily detected by standard (amplicon sequencing) methods. We are using *high-throughput* next-genetation sequencing to implement shotgun metagenomics and modern bioinformatic approaches to resolve strain level differences in the gut bacterial community.

**Result**:
