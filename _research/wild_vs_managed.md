**Context**: 
  * In Europe or North America, honeybees (_Apis mellifera_) that you've seen flying about was most likely from a managed farm or escaped from one (this is being freshly debated). 
  * "Wild" honeybees are only found across parts of Africa and Asia which is their natural habitat but, they have been transported by humans across the world over the past few centuries. 
  * With their simple and specialized gut microbiomes, honeybees make a great model to study the effects of domestication on the gut microbiome.

**Challenge**:
  * _Locating and sampling wild honeybees_ from across the world is a daunting task. Thanks to our _international collaborators_ across Africa and amazing field ecologists from Germany, we have assembled an extensive collection of hundreds of honeybee samples.
  * The _differences are likely to be sublte_ and cannot be eaily detected by standard (amplicon sequencing) methods. We are using _high-throughput_ next-genetation sequencing to implement shotgun metagenomics and modern bioinformatic approaches to resolve strain level differences in the gut bacterial community.

**Expectations and Results**:
  * We have identified a number of species that are found in wild and managed honeybees and are currently investigating their distribution across colonies of different types.
  * Our collection of wild honeybees span across different contries in Africa with each location harboring a different subspecies of _Apis mellifera_. From our [previous work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.11.612390v1.full) we expect that the strain-level differences in the gut microbiome will reflect the [evolutionary history](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35937-4) of the honeybee subspecies.
