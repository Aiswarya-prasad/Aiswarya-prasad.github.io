<!-- Describe the priority effects project as problem challenge and expectations and results. problem is need to understand factors influencing and maintaing strain-level community composition in microbiomes. microbe-microbe interactions in the context of a microbial community at the strain-level are still faced with  limited understanding. honeybees are a great model to study this invitro. using community of lacto and bifido strains investigating prioiority effects. developed a high-throughput compatible pacbio metagenomic approach to quantitatively detect strains in the gut. pilot experiment revealed priority effects carried out more replicates and combinations of strains and analysing the data now-->

**Problem**: 
  * Understanding the factors influencing and maintaining strain-level community composition in microbiomes is crucial for predicting and manipulating microbial communities. 
  * Microbe-microbe interactions in the context of a microbial community at the strain-level are still understudied. 
  * Honeybees are a great model to study this _in vivo_ due to their simple gut microbiome and the experimental tractability of the host and microbiota.

**Challenge**:
    * Investigating priority effects in a community of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in the honeybee gut.
    * Developing a high-throughput compatible PacBio metagenomic approach to quantitatively detect strains in the gut.

**Expectations and Results**:
    * We expect that the priority effects will be seen at the strain-level and that species will coexist by niche partitioning as has been [shown](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68583) among in honeybee Lactobacillus species by a collegue.
    * We have developed a high-throughput compatible PacBio metagenomic approach to quantitatively detect strains in the gut.
    * A pilot experiment points to clear signs of co-existance of species but priority effects between strains of the same species.
    * I carried out more replicates and combinations of strains and am currently analyzing the data to confirm the observations from the pilot experiment.
